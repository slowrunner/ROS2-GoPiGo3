# Install From Image
## 1) Download the custom image to your computer



## 2) Flash SD card with Raspberry Pi Imager v1.73 or higher:  
  (See https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/ for latest Raspberry Pi Imager)  
  
  Select CHOOSE OS  
  - (scroll to bottom) Use custom  
    - navigate to the saved location of the ```ros2hhv4.img.gz``` image  
    - click Open  

  Select CHOOSE STORAGE (DANGER! - CHOOSE WISELY)  
  - Select your __GB SD Card (Minimum 8GB)  
  
  Select SETTINGS Gear in lower right  
  - Set hostname:  ROS2HH  
  - Enable SSH:  
    - Use password authentication  
  - Set username and password:  
    - ubuntu  
    - robots1234   (use this for first boot)
  - Configure wireless LAN for your WiFi  
    - SSID:  "__Your_WiFi_SSID__"  
    - Password:  "__Your_WiFi_password__"   
    - Wireless LAN country:  US  
  - Set locale settings:  
    - Time zone:  America/New_York

  Click SAVE  
  Click WRITE

  When complete and "safe to remove", pull the ROS2HH microSD card out  
  
=== Mount the card to allow headless configuration  
- Pull card out, reinsert for next step  
```
NOTE:  On some computers (e.g. Linux MATE on my 9 yr old laptop)  
       Imager may result in an error message:  
       "Could not mount FAT32 partition for writing"  

       If you see this, the network-config   
       was not rewritten, fix this in the next step.
       
```

=== Verify WiFi Headless config **and add ethernet**:  
Re-Insert the uSD card to your computer:
- On Mac:
  - Browse system-boot partition  
  - Show in enclosing folder   
  - Open Terminal at folder

- On Linux: 
  - In terminal: cd /media/\<user\>/system-boot


$ nano network-config  
```
version 2
ethernets:
   eth0:
     dhcp4: true
     dhcp6: false
     optional: true
wifis:  
  renderer: networkd
  wlan0:  
    dhcp4: true 
    dhcp6: false
    optional: true             
    access-points:  
      "your_SSID":  
        password: "your_netpswd"  (This may be a long encrypted thing if written correctly by Imager)  
```
- exit ctrl-x y  

NOTE:  this info will be read by cloud-init to generate /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml on the first boot

unmount microSD card

now ... 
  - Open a command shell on your desktop/laptop  
  - Remove any existing ssh key for your GoPiGo3's IP on your desktop/laptop  
    - ssh-keygen -R x.x.x.x  
  - SSH into your ROS2 GoPiGo3  
    - ssh ubuntu@x.x.x.x

    Retype new password: __________


## 5)  === TEST GoPiGo COMMUNICATION    
(Test Raspberry Pi communication with GoPiGo3 hardware control board)  
- Type ```./test_c``` and press Tab key,   
$ ./test_communication.sh     
```
*** ROS2 GOPIGO3 COMMUNICATION TEST - Read_info.py  
Manufacturer    :  Dexter Industries  
Board           :  GoPiGo3  
Serial Number   :  xxx  
Hardware version:  3.x.x  
Firmware version:  1.0.0

5v voltage      :  4.985  
```

## 6) === TEST GoPiGo3 MOTORS
- Type ```./test_m``` and press Tab key,
$ ./test_motors.sh
```
*** TEST GOPIGO3 MOTORS  
GOPIGO3 should:  
- Spin right about 90 degrees  
- Pause for a few seconds  
- Spin left about 180 degrees  
- Spin right, back approximately to starting heading  

*** NOT A PROBLEM IF DID NOT TURN TO EXACT 90 and -90 HEADINGS  
```
